**App Name:** Reverse Bundle Pro

**App Tagline:** Reduce fulfillment costs by up to 40% through intelligent order bundling

**App Description:**
```
Transform your fulfillment operations with smart reverse bundling technology. Automatically convert individual item orders into cost-effective pre-bundled SKUs when customers order compatible products together.

‚Ä¢ Reduce pick-and-pack costs by up to 40%
‚Ä¢ Maintain unchanged customer experience  
‚Ä¢ Automatic detection of bundle opportunities
‚Ä¢ Real-time cost savings tracking
‚Ä¢ Seamless fulfillment provider integration

üí° HOW IT WORKS:
When customers order compatible items (like phone case + screen protector + charging cable), our AI automatically converts these to a single bundle SKU for your fulfillment center. Your warehouse picks 1 item instead of 3, saving significant labor costs.

‚Ä¢ CSV exports for traditional 3PLs  
‚Ä¢ API integrations for modern providers
‚Ä¢ Real-time order sync and tracking

‚ö° SMART BUNDLING:
