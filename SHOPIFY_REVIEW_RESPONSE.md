## Response to Review Feedback

Dear Shopify App Review Team,

Thank you for your thorough review of Reverse Bundle Pro. We appreciate your attention to detail and are committed to ensuring our app meets all Shopify App Store requirements. Below, we address each of the issues you identified:

### 1. App Name Consistency ✅ RESOLVED

**Issue:** App name mismatch between TOML file and submission form.

**Resolution:** The app name is consistently set as "Reverse Bundle Pro" in both:

This has been verified and is consistent across all configuration files.

### 4. Image URLs in Wrong Fields ✅ INVESTIGATED - NO ISSUES FOUND

**Issue:** URLs found in images that should be in proper App Store fields.

**Resolution:** After thorough investigation of our codebase, we found no image URLs embedded in image files or placed in incorrect fields. All images in the app are:

- **UI Components**: Using Shopify Polaris EmptyState components with proper CDN URLs
- **App Store Assets**: Properly configured through the App Store submission interface
- **No Embedded URLs**: No URLs found in image metadata or alt text fields

The only image URLs found are legitimate Polaris component images hosted on Shopify's CDN for empty states.

### 5. Subscription Plan Switching UI Bugs ✅ FIXED

**Issue:** Errors in plan changes through both app UI and App Store index.

**Resolution:** We have identified and fixed several UI bugs in the billing system:

#### Issues Fixed:
- **Loading State Management**: Improved state synchronization between fetcher and UI
- **Race Conditions**: Added proper guards to prevent multiple simultaneous requests
- **App Store Redirect Logic**: Simplified redirect handling to prevent conflicts
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced error messages and user feedback
- **Button States**: Added disabled states during loading to prevent double-clicks

#### Technical Improvements:
- **Simplified useEffect Logic**: Removed complex client-side only rendering
- **Better State Management**: Consolidated loading states and error handling
- **Improved Error Messages**: More descriptive error messages for users
- **Button Guards**: Disabled buttons during processing to prevent multiple submissions

#### Testing:
- All plan upgrade buttons now properly redirect to Shopify App Store

- Error handling provides clear feedback
- No more race conditions or double-submissions
